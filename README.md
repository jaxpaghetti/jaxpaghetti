- please dont be graphic with gore or ask first cuz it is rlly situational some things make me queasy HELP
- my discord is still furretkechi let me know if you're sending me a request cuz i dont accept reqs from people if i cant tell who it is yknow
- im socially awkward so if i come off as rude and avoiding you my bad broseph
- despite that i luv when ppl who share interests sit with me so dont be scared unless ur scared of awkward silence
- i will block you if you sit/stand on top of me too long its not a touch trigger or anythin just annoys me 🥀
- pls ask to take inspo from my ponies...i likely wont mind it but it kinda freaks me out when someones a 99.9% replica of something i made unprompted if that makes sense lol
